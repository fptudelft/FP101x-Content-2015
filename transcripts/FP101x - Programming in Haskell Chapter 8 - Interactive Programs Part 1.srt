00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,520
Hello, everybody! Welcome back

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,279
at the next episode of functional
programming 101

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,679
and today we are going to talk about

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,980
interactive programs. But before we
start

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,619
I want to share a story that I
originally heard from Simon Peyton Jones.

6
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,890
Simon Peyton Jones, everybody
should know,

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,070
is one of the main drivers behind

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,269
Haskell and also

9
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,880
one of the founders of the Glasgow
Haskell Compiler that

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,940
we have been using in this course.

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,040
Here is the story. In this little box

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,210
there is a super powerful quantum
computer.

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,559
It's extremely powerful. It can
break every encryption scheme

14
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,770
known to man. It can solve any
problem. It cures cancer...

15
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,649
everything! The only problem is that

16
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:05,170
it has no I/O. So we will never know

17
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,400
whether this quantum computer works

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,840
or not. The moral of this story is that

19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,210
if your program is not able to
communicate

20
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,509
with the outside world, it might as well

21
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:24,780
not exist. And if you go back to the
early days of Haskell

22
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,400
it was actually really hard to have a
Haskell program

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,369
communicate with the outside world.
Whereas if you use

24
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:36,790
any other programming language it's
trivial.

25
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,090
The first code we all write is hello world
which prints "hello world"

26
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,439
on the standard output, whereas in
Haskell

27
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,140
that hello world was super complicated.

28
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,030
First we had stream I/O, then we had
continuation based I/O and

29
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,439
finally, and that's what we are going to
talk about today

30
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,270
we have the I/O monad. And with the I/O
monad

31
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,900


32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,820
Haskell has gotten its I/O port

33
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,090
on the box, such that it can easily
communicate

34
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,140
with the outside world.

35
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,260
So far we have only written programs
that

36
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:27,430
take some input and return a string
or an integer or a tuple or a list

37
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,730
and we have printed that value

38
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,990
on the output of the

39
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,520
REPL loop, of the GHC interpreter.

40
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,130
But what we really want to do, is we want
to write

41
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,520
programs like most programs, like every

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,560
Java program, like every C# program, like

43
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,060
any imperative program, that takes

44
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,550
inputs from the external world, does
something with it

45
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,840
and produces output.

46
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,410
And in fact what we want, is that it
produces output

47
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,780
as it's getting new inputs.

48
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,920
So we want to produce outputs
as we are getting

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,730
new inputs. So what this program has to do

50
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,020
it has to interact with the keyboard

51
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,590
and the screen. If we

52
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,709
look at our program as a function

53
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:28,709
in some sense now it becomes dependent
on the keyboard

54
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,290
and besides just producing output

55
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,580
it also will communicate with the screen.

56
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,430
The problem

57
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,260
is that Haskell programs are

58
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,660
pure functions, which means they cannot
have side effects.

59
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,739
Maybe it is good to

60
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,739
informally talk about

61
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:57,730
what a mathematical function is.
A mathe..

62
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,730
That's a complex word!

63
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,160
A mathematical function is

64
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,440
a function that when you give it the
same

65
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,090
argument will always give you the same
result.

66
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,160
For example, factorial

67
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,190
when I give it n

68
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:20,000
it will return factorial n. When I give
it n again

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,080
it will return factorial of n again. Now
look at a common function

70
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,670
that we use in imperative programming,
for example

71
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,870
readLine. ReadLine takes no arguments or

72
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:38,780
the empty tuple and returns a string.
When I call readLine again

73
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,330
with the same arguments, the same empty
tuple, it will return a different string.

74
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,900
So readLine is not a mathematical
function

75
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,040
and the reason is because it has side
effects.

76
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,150
So it will return a string

77
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,810
but there is something there that is not
apparent in the type.

78
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,330
And that's what the I/O monad

79
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,380
solves. The I/O monad expresses

80
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,430
in the type of a function that this
function

81
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,440
has a side effect. So interactive
programs, programs that

82
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,000
interact with the outside world, have
side effects

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,870
and we need a way to incorporate side
effects

84
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,540
in Haskell programs.

85
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,060
I don't think that side effects are bad.

86
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,030
Actually they are super useful
because without side effects it is

87
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,560
really hard to write these

88
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,180
interactive programs. But the thing is
that you have to make sure

89
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,330
again it's a balance, it's a question of
taste

90
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,520
how you use those side effects.
It's a little bit like salt or spices

91
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,240
in food.

92
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,850
You can overdo it and your food is too
salty and it doesn't taste well

93
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,400
but if you don't use any salt

94
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,510
your food is also not tasty.

95
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,080
So it is up to you as a developer

96
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,500
to decide how much side effects to use.

97
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,890
But it is never a good answer to say

98
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,910
I'm never going to use side effects

99
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,200
or it is also never good, the other
extreme, to say

100
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,600
I don't care about purity.

101
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,880
That is exactly what shows mastery of
programming

102
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,100
that you can decide where to use side
effects

103
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,350
and where to avoid them. But if I hear
you say

104
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,310


105
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,240
we have to program without any side
effects, you have not

106
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,900
understood the essence of this course.

107
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,620
As I mentioned, the solution to
the problem is to introduce a new type

108
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,160
and we really don't care how this type
is defined.

109
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,210
For now we will just assume

110
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,480
it is some abstract type: IO of a.

111
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,950
And this type denotes an action

112
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,620
that will perform some side effects and
as a result

113
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,140
will return a value of type a.

114
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:12,160


115
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,550
Maybe a good way to

116
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,840
remember the difference, is that in
Haskell so far we have only used

117
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,730
expressions

118
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,990
but we didn't mention statements, whereas
in an imperative

119
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,340
language there are expressions and there
are statements, where statements

120
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,560
mostly communicate via side effects. And

121
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,060
in some sense by introducing the I/O monad

122
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,710
we are also introducing statements in
Haskell.

123
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,390
Or another way to say that is
we introduce the notion of

124
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:48,600
actions in Haskell. But these actions
themselves

125
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,350
are also expressions, so they can be
composed. Let's look at some concrete

126
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,230
examples

127
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,530
of the I/O monad. Here is IO of Char

128
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:02,590
which is the type of an action that will
perform some side effects

129
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,080
and then return a character. And then

130
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,150
the most imperative

131
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,950
of imperative types, that is IO of unit.

132
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,790
That is a function that only performs
side effects.

133
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,050
The only interesting thing it does is
performing side effects.

134
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,780
Because it has no real result value, it
returns the empty tuple.

135
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,210
And in a typical imperative language

136
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,800
this would be the type void. So if you
have a function that returns void

137
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,280
in Haskell that becomes a function that
returns

138
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,520
type IO of unit.

139
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,180


140
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,290
This empty tuple is nothing special.

141
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:51,320
It's just a tuple that has no
components. Now

142
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,790
that we have this type, and again we
really don't care how the I/O monad is

143
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,540
defined

144
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,770
as long as we have operations

145
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,399
defined on them. So this is a little
bit like

146
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,940
object-oriented programming. We have a
class.

147
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,899
We have methods on that class. And in
order to use

148
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:14,730
a class, you don't need to know how that
class is implemented.

149
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,700
You just use the methods, and that's the
same thing here

150
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,690
with the I/O monad. And the first operation
that we have

151
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,490
on the I/O monad here is getChar. In

152
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,820
a typical imperative language, getChar

153
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,040
has type

154
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,080
unit arrow char.

155
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,220
In Haskell, because we are lazy, we don't
need the unit arrow.

156
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,510
And so instead getChar is just

157
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,010
something that has a side effect and then

158
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,820
returns a character. If this would
be strict

159
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,150
it would immediately return a character

160
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,550
right there.

161
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,240
But since Haskell is lazy, we don't have to

162
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,529
have this explicit thunk that defers
evaluation.

163
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:08,040
That's another interesting thing.

164
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,810
In typical imperative languages, whenever
you see a function that has type unit

165
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,370
arrow something, it means that you are
trying to simulate

166
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,350
laziness. Here is another

167
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,790
example. The function

168
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,360
putChar, which writes a character to
the standard output.

169
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,820
It takes a character and it returns void.

170
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,490
It has side effects, but it doesn't
return any

171
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,040
useful value. And then

172
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,100
just like for parsers, we have the

173
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,339
action that immediately returns without
doing anything.

174
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:53,140
So it takes a value and it immediately
returns that value

175
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,840
without performing

176
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,100
any further side effects. And then

177
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,470
we will be using the same kind of
sequencing that we used for parsers.

178
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,330
And again, in the exercises you will

179
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,710
see how this do notation

180
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,510
is translated in terms of the bind

181
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,520
function. But right now

182
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,150
we will just use the do notation, because
it looks very much like

183
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,260
traditional imperative code. So here is a
function

184
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,990
that reads a character, reads another
character but

185
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,210
ignores the result, and then reads a
third character

186
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:40,040
and returns the pair of those two. So if
you remember the parsers from the last

187
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,650
lecture

188
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,380
we had more or less exactly the same
example here

189
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,350
except that we used the item parser
three times and here

190
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:54,400
we are reading a character from the
standard input. We can

191
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,800
define a function using getChar

192
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,630
that reads a string from the standard
input as follows:

193
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,980
we read a character, we call that
character x.

194
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,430
Notice that getChar has type IO of Char

195
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,010
and then x here has type Char.

196
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,440
So the arrow is very similar to the
arrow in generators in list

197
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,780
comprehensions. So there is an

198
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,160
IO of t on the right and then there is

199
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,420
a t on the left of the arrow. And that's
why

200
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,610
we use the arrow symbol and not

201
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,340
the equals symbol, because the type on this
side is different than the type

202
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,000
on that side. If the character that we
just read is

203
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,230
the new line, then we are done
so we return

204
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,990
the empty string. Otherwise we
recursively

205
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,730
read on to read the rest of this
character

206
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,120
and then we return the previous
character that we read

207
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,900
concatenated on the string that we
recursively write.

208
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,070
So another recursive

209
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,610
thing here, where we just

210
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:14,210
call this thing itself recursively, until
we hit the new line

211
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:20,230
and then we return all the values. Here
is an example

212
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,010
that takes a string and writes it to the
standard output.

213
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:29,580
If we have the empty string, we cannot
do anything, so we just

214
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:35,040
return unit immediately. If we have a
string that starts with a character x

215
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,380
followed by a string xs

216
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,530
we print the first character and
then recursively

217
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,210
we print the rest of the string on the
screen.

218
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:50,330
This guy here returns IO of unit, so the
whole thing returns IO of

219
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:55,440
unit and everything fits. Now

220
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,680
we can define

221
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,700
another function that simply combines
putString with putChar

222
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,170
to write a new line behind it, so we
first print the string

223
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:13,170
and then we print a new line. The beauty
of all this

224
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,450
is that we can mix and match imperative
code or I/O

225
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,690
code with all the functions that we
have defined before.

226
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:26,040
In particular functions over lists,
because strings are just lists.

227
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,280
So we can imperatively read

228
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,490
a string from the standard input. Then

229
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:37,270
use regular list

230
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,690
functions on that string and then

231
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,870
imperatively

232
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,290
within the I/O monad write this to the
standard output.

233
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:51,240
So let's walk through this example. We

234
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,070
print "Enter a string", we read this

235
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,900
line from the input and then we print

236
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,510
that that line has so many characters.

237
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,920
Very simple, but you see here you combine
there's an

238
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,600
island of purity in the sea of impurity.

239
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,199
And this is a perfect perfect perfect way
to program.

240
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:18,279
So you have little parts of pure code
embedded

241
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:23,589
in a context of impure code. And when we

242
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,639
run this string length in GHCi

243
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,930
it will print "Enter a string", we
type a string

244
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,130
and it will tell us that this string has
five characters.

245
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,699
Note that this thing is only

246
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:43,259
evaluated for the side effects. It
doesn't return

247
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:46,279
a useful value and we see that

248
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:51,800
because it has type IO of unit. This is
the end of part 1.

249
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,680
See you in a few minutes when we are
continuing to talk about the I/O monad.

250
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:57,980
Thank you!

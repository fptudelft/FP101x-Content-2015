1
00:00:01,189 --> 00:00:03,649
Hey everybody, and welcome back to

2
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:07,149
FP101x - Functional Programming.

3
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:10,340
What we're going

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,009
to do today is taking the first

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,160
baby steps in learning Haskell.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,390
One of my favorite movies of all time

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,890
is the Karate Kid and if you haven't
seen this movie,

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,170
stop watching

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,200
this lecture and go watch this movie
first.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,030
Every time I need to learn something new,
I rewatch the Karate Kid

11
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,730
and I can tell you... I've seen it
maybe

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,210
20-30 times and every time I watch it,

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,820
I learn something new.
If you

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,890
watch the movie, you will see that

15
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,500
the boy here, Daniel, wants
to learn karate

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,390
and mister Miyagi, the gentleman
here

17
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,320
on the other side, makes him do a
lot of

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,320
what Daniel thinks are pointless
exercises. And he gets kind of frustrated.

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,400
But in order to learn something you have
to go

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,650
through a lot of exercises because
there's a lot of muscle memory or, in

21
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,049
case of programming you have to have the
muscle memory in your fingers. They're

22
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:22,950
certain things should not have to think
about.

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,520
That you have to drill. That you have to
do over and over and over again.

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,430
And that's what we are going to do in
this lecture today.

25
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,070
So don't get frustrated, don't be like
Daniel.

26
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,280
Be a grownup and just do your exercises

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,420
on and on: wax on wax off, wax on, wax off...

28
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,640
until it becomes completely automatic

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,450
and then you can use your brain to solve
the real problem.

30
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,649
You don't have to think about the basics
anymore. And every time you learn

31
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:56,549
something new

32
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,049
rewatch this great movie.

33
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,560
Let's show some Haskell. The Haskell implementation
that we're using

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,319
in this course is the Glasgow Haskell
Compiler

35
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,530
sometimes also called the Glorious
Haskell Compiler

36
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,190
and GHC is the leading implementation of
Haskell.

37
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,540
It has both a compiler and an
interactive

38
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,900
REPL loop that you can use to type in
your

39
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,310
code.
The interactive nature

40
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,300
of the GHC interpreter makes it really
easy

41
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,459
to experiment with Haskell

42
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:40,769
and that's why it's also very useful for
this course.

43
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:44,330
Many of the exercises

44
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,790
that you will get during the course, you
can do

45
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,519
by using GHC.
I don't

46
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,800
see that as cheating because

47
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,730
as programmers, we should really use the
compiler

48
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:04,420
to help us. The computer is there
to help us program the computer.

49
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,660
If we don't use that, that would be
stupid. GHC

50
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:14,079
is freely available from the website
here. The link will be also be on the

51
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:17,880
course website, and you can also

52
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,220
Google or Bing for the Haskell platform

53
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,780
and it's available for all major
platforms

54
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,910
Mac, Windows and Linux.
To start GHC,

55
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,840
you just type from the command line 'ghci'

56
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,549
and then you get some

57
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:41,230
text blurps and there you see a prompt

58
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,970
Prelude> and that's where you can start
typing in

59
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,180
expressions. For example we can type in
the expression

60
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,150
2 + 3 * 4 and

61
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,690
GHCi will then print the result for that.
In this case we're really using

62
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,380
GHCi as kind of a calculator.

63
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,250
It's a little bit like a calculator
on the command line interface,

64
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,340
instead of a calculator with buttons.
What we also see here is that since

65
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,680
2 + 3 * 4 apparently is 14

66
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,459
that multiplication binds stronger

67
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,640
than addition. So there's no surprises
there as

68
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,450
most languages have that.
If we want to

69
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,450
first do the addition and then
the multiplication, we have to put

70
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,510
parentheses, so we write
(2 + 3) * 4

71
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,910
and then the result is 20.
We can do

72
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,880
more complicated expressions like the
square root of (3 ^ 2 + 4 ^2)

73
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,690
and we get 5.

74
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,100
As you saw, there was the
Prelude>

75
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,490
prompt

76
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,260
here. So the Haskell Prelude it's like
the SDK for Haskell. These are all the

77
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,390
standard functions

78
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,330
that come for free with Haskell.
On the website

79
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,930
we will tell you how to get
other libraries for Haskell,

80
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:13,620
but we won't discuss that in too much
detail right here. You

81
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,740
you can read up on that.
We will

82
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,840
will try to stick with just the
standard library functions - the standard

83
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,390
prelude.

84
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:27,680
A lot of the functions in the prelude

85
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,710
are functions over lists.

86
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,750
We're going to walk through a
couple of them and then in later lectures

87
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,810
we will implemented these functions in
several different

88
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,500
manners. The first function here is head,
which takes a list,

89
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,350
and the way we write lists in Haskell
is with square brackets and the

90
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,280
elements separated by commas,

91
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,030
so the head of [1,2,3,4,5] is

92
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,110
unsurprisingly 1.
The tail,

93
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,130
that's the opposite of head, so is
everything on the list

94
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,340
except the head, so the tail of [1,2,3,4,5]

95
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,710
is the list [2,3,4,5].
We can also select

96
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,360
the n-th element of the list with
this

97
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,250
double exclamation mark operator.
If we want to select the second element

98
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,160
of the list

99
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,320
[1,2,3,4,5] we get

100
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,030
3. So what do we learn from this?
Well...

101
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,029
that the first element of the list

102
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:29,610
has index 0.

103
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,749
Haskell starts

104
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:36,849
indexing lists by zero.
There's

105
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:40,409
2 exclamation marks here and there's

106
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:44,159
a good reason for that:
because in Haskell,

107
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:47,189
lists are not arrays,
so indexing

108
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:50,909
into the list here at the second
element

109
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:54,729
will traverse the list. So it
will traverse the list, throw away 1

110
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:59,509
throw away 2 and then return 3.
This is not a constant time

111
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:04,209
operation. Indexing into a list, unlike
indexing into an array,

112
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:07,919
in Haskell is linear in the length
of the list.

113
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,099
In general linear in the size of the

114
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:13,599
list.

115
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,509
But fortunately

116
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:21,180
we will hardly see uses

117
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,629
of this operator in practice.

118
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:28,550
If you find yourself wanting to use list
indexing

119
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:34,180
then you know that you have not done
enough wax on, wax off, wax on, wax off.

120
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,569
Tou're still too much in the mindset of

121
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:40,689
imperative programming using arrays.

122
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:45,189
In Haskell we typically use higher
order functions like map, filter, fold

123
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:48,300
and not indexing to

124
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,119
perform complex operations over lists.
Here's another

125
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:59,719
example - take 3 - it takes the first
three elements of a list. If we have

126
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:01,180
the list [1,2,3,4,5]

127
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,680
it returns the first three
elements

128
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,139
[1,2,3]
Drop

129
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:11,619
is the opposite, so it takes a number

130
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:16,719
and a list and it drops the first
three elements of the list. In some

131
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:17,769
sense, drop

132
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:20,819
and take are

133
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,300
the generalizations of head and tail.
Head and tail

134
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,159
just take the first and the rest of the
list and then with take and drop

135
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,130
you can generalize that
to arbitrary numbers.

136
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,370
Calculating the length of the list...

137
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,459
we do that by

138
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:44,930
calling the function length.
Length of [1,2,3,4,5] is 5.

139
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,180
Again, lists in Haskell are not
like arrays

140
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,910
in other languages, so taking the length
is not a constant time operation.

141
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,070
It takes time linearly in the
length of the list.

142
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:04,890
Sum sums up all the elements so
if we call sum of [1,2,3,4,5]

143
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,040
the result is 15.
Product

144
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,570
is the same as sum, except instead of
adding up the numbers, it

145
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,080
multiplies all of them, so
multiplying

146
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,520
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 - like taking
the factorial of 5 -

147
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,649
is 120. Appending two lists is another
common operation: you take 2 lists and

148
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:30,290
you smash them together into a new list,
so if I

149
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,570
append [1,2,3] with [4,5]

150
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,660
we get the list [1,2,3,4,5].
The last function here

151
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,220
on this slide is reversing a list.

152
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,260
Reverse [1,2,3,4,5] gives you

153
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,380
[5,4,3,2,1]
In the rest of

154
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,990
these lectures, we will define all
these functions ourselves

155
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,300
in several ways, but right now

156
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,600
it's good to play with them to
see what they do,

157
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,040
and then we will be ready to
implement them.

158
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,640
Then we will know what they are
supposed to do.

159
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,380
Here's

160
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,260
another very important slide

161
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,839
and that is about function application.
Haskell

162
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:24,450
is very different than mathematics on
the one side

163
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,700
and very different from other
programming languages as well.

164
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,910
In mathematics when you apply a function -
mathematics that you do in school or

165
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,860
college when you take analysis -

166
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,100
when you apply a function to an argument,

167
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,649
you always use parentheses.
In this case

168
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:45,100
when we apply a function here...
this is

169
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,410
applying a function f to arguments
a and b

170
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,180
and then adding c

171
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,910
space d.
In mathematics,

172
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,460
typically, and that comes from
physics

173
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,720
is that space means multiplication.

174
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,300
If you look at the mathematical
textbook

175
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,430
and you see c d

176
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,800
it usually means c multiplied by d

177
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,480
and therefore when you apply a function
you're using

178
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,330
parentheses like this to disambiguate.
Since in Haskell

179
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,530
function application is used much more
often

180
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,990
than multiplication,
whereas in physics

181
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,630
multiplication is used more often, so
that's where

182
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:40,080
multiplication is given the most
white symbol, the least

183
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,680
visible symbol, the most white spacey symbol.
In Haskell,

184
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,680
function application is denoted by white
space

185
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,050
so that it's not so much in
your face.

186
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,050
So in Haskell instead of writing
f (a,b) + c d

187
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:58,960
function application
becomes

188
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,660
denoted by a space,
so it's f a b + c * d

189
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,540
In most programming languages

190
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,790
you would write

191
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,540
f (a, b) so they are in
some sense the

192
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,680
worst of two worlds: there you
have to write everything explicit.

193
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,970
In Haskell we made the decision that
function application

194
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,900
is done by using a space and
multiplication

195
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,500
is done by using multiplication.

196
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,080
Also,

197
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,480
function application binds stronger

198
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,790
than any other operator.
If you see

199
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,820
f a + b, that means
f applied to a

200
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,970
plus b,
It doesn't mean f

201
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,250
applied to (a + b).

202
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,080
People have to get used to this.
This doesn't mean

203
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,210
f times a plus b.
It means

204
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,350
f applied

205
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,400
to a plus b.
So that's

206
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,370
kind of similar to multiplication binding
stronger than addition.

207
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,800
Here's a table that give you

208
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,210
a couple of more expressions

209
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,410
on the one side Haskell,

210
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,750
and on the other side mathematics.
So this is what you should forget.

211
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,240
I'm going to stand in front of that..this
is what you should forget.

212
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,320
And this is what you should learn.

213
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,590
So forget what's behind me and learn

214
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,670
what's on this side.

215
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,890
Instead of f open parentheses x,
we write

216
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:50,420
f space x. Instead of passing two
parameters to f

217
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,230
we apply f to x and then
apply that result to y.

218
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:00,540
Instead of f open parens g, open parens x
we can write

219
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,110
f of g of x and later we'll see

220
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,120
that we can write that using function
composition

221
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,680
as f composed g.

222
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,940
the rest of the examples

223
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,720
should be obvious.
If you just look at

224
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,680
shapes of these two - don't try to
interpret them - you will see that the

225
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,300
Haskell code here

226
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,650
looks much lighter-weight than the code

227
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:33,070
on this side. Haskell programmers are
lazy - we don't want to type too much -

228
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,470
so this looks much more beautiful
than this

229
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,860
and that's why Haskell's syntax is designed
the way it is.

230
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,350
Thank you!.
This was the end of Part 1.

231
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,680
See you in a bit for the remainder of

232
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,320
chapter 1.

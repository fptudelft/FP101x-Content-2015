1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,449
Hey everybody! Welcome back. In the

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,330
previous segment we looked at a simple
recursive type

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,730
of natural numbers and in this segment

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,280
we are going to look at a couple of more
interesting

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,760
recursive types. And in particular

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,010
I like this type. Remember when we
were doing the parser

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,099
we were trying to build a

8
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,689
abstract syntax tree, that

9
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:32,719
represented the structure of our string

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,579
as a tree. But when we were doing parsers,
we didn't know yet

11
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,120
how to define new types, so instead

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,270
we computed the value of the expression
as we were parsing.

13
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,059
But with recursive types we can define

14
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:54,360
an algebraic data type of expressions and
then define various

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,730
interesting functions over those
expressions. How would we define

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,780
expressions in Haskell? Well, again

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,780
we define an abstract base class Expr

18
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,049
and then three concrete subtypes: simple
value

19
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:14,380
multiplication and addition

20
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:20,580
of expressions. We can now write that
tree on the previous slide

21
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,790
as follows: we add 1 to

22
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:30,110
2 times 3. Once we have

23
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,000
expressions like this, we can define
recursive functions

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,060
over these expressions. And again they all
follow the same structure. We pattern

25
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:40,829
match

26
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,479
over each case. You see that here.
You don't have to

27
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,579
look at the definitions yet, just look at
those pattern matches and then we do something

28
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:48,960
here.

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,159
And in this case, when we want to compute
the size of an expression we want to

30
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:54,880
count

31
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,210
how many values appear in that
expression.

32
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,500
If it is a value, it's 1. Otherwise we

33
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,640
recursively calculate the size of the
left and the right hand side

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,129
and add them up. In an
object-oriented language

35
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,680
you would probably make

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,959
size into a virtual method of

37
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,540
the expression superclass and then
override

38
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,439
that virtual method in each of the
concrete subtypes.

39
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,090
Here is the evaluator for expressions or
the interpreter.

40
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,560
So what it does is it takes an
expression and calculates the integer

41
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,230
value.

42
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,189
If you already have a value you are done.
Otherwise

43
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:40,650
you evaluate the left hand side and the
right hand side

44
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,530
and if you happen to have an
addition you add them up

45
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,049
and in case you have a multiplication you
multiply them.

46
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:53,549
When you look at the structure of those

47
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,950
functions, what you see

48
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:02,359
is that all they are doing is they are
replacing the constructors

49
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:06,019
respectively Val, Add and Mul

50
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,040
by other functions. So let's go back here
and check that.

51
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,849
So in this case I replace the
constructor Val

52
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:18,760
by the constant function 1. Here I
replace the constructor Add

53
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,180
by plus and Mul by plus. And for the
evaluator

54
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,349
we replace this constructor by the
identity

55
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:31,669
Add by plus and the constructor Mul

56
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,040
by times. And guess what?

57
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,180
If we would define a foldr over
expressions

58
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,639
then we don't have to write 2 recursive
functions. We can do it once

59
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,069
and in that case for example the eval
function

60
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:51,109
simply reads as follows: we

61
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:55,430
replace Val, the Val constructor,
by the identity

62
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,669
we replace the Add

63
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:01,689
constructor by plus and we replace

64
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:07,250
the multiplication constructor by times.

65
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,319
Next example: binary trees.

66
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,349
Here is a picture of a binary tree.

67
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:16,530
We will deal with binary trees

68
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,430
that have values in the nodes and values

69
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:26,030
in the leaves. And that leads to the
following recursive definition.

70
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,170
A Tree is either a Leaf with an integer

71
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,310
or it is a Node with two subtrees and

72
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,520
an integer right there. And

73
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,050
the picture of the previous slide
becomes this:

74
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,290
we had a Node with 5 at the root

75
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:48,140
and two subnodes, that had a 3
and a 7 respectively

76
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,580
et cetera. So this value here

77
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,320
represents that picture. You see
5, 3, 7

78
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,540
1, 4, 6, 9.

79
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,910
3, 5, 7, 1, 4

80
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,700
6, 9. That sounds like a telephone number.

81
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,570
Just like on expressions we can define

82
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:16,010
recursive functions on the structure of
binary trees.

83
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,090
For example we can search if a given

84
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,530
integer is present

85
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,320
in this binary tree and then we will
return a boolean.

86
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,460
And we have two cases.

87
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,310
If we have a Leaf, then we check that the
value at the Leaf

88
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,500
is the same as the value that we are
looking for, and that's the result of the

89
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,540
boolean, the recursive invocation.

90
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,880
When we have a Node,

91
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,880
we check whether the value at that Node

92
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,200
is the one we are looking for, or

93
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,500
we check whether the value occurs in the
left subtree

94
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,530
or we check whether it appears

95
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,669
in the right subtree.

96
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:07,040
But when the integer does not occur in
the tree

97
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,260
we will traverse the whole tree.

98
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,880
That is

99
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,960
the algorithm there.

100
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,229
Now let's look at another function here.

101
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:26,850
Let's try to find it in a different way.
Let's first say we take the Tree and

102
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,020
we flatten it into a list.

103
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,490
So when we have a Leaf, we return a
singleton list.

104
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:38,640
When we have a Tree with a left and a
right subtree and a Node

105
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,210
we first flatten the left subtree, we
splice in that

106
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,300
value and then we append the right
subtree.

107
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,020
Now we say that a Tree is a search tree

108
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,690
if when we flatten it into a list, it is

109
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,750
sorted. So our example

110
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,170
is a search tree, because

111
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,330
when we flatten it, we get

112
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,750
a sorted list: [1,3,4,5,6,7,9].

113
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,840
So now we can define

114
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,580
occurs as follows.

115
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,240
If we have a search tree we can check
whether it is a

116
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,810
Leaf. When we have a Node, we check
whether

117
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:31,510
the values are the same, we return
True.

118
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,690
Now since we know more about the
structure we

119
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,510
only traverse one path down the Tree.

120
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,500
So we don't have to say: if it is not the
same we are checking this

121
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,790
or we are checking that. No, we know
that if

122
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,710
m is less than n, if the number that
we are searching for

123
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:56,570
is less than the Node here, then we only
have to search in the left subtree.

124
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,980
If this gentlemen here

125
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,080
is larger than n, then we only have to
search

126
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,360
in the right Tree. So now we don't have

127
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,720
to search the whole Tree, because we have
exploited

128
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,710
the fact that the values in the Tree

129
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:21,310
are in a certain relation and we defined
that relation by saying

130
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,380
when you flatten the Tree the result is
a sorted list.

131
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,300
Happy hacking

132
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,400
and see you next week.

1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,060
Welcome everybody

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,350
to the next lecture of functional
programming 101x.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,480
Today we're going to talk about list
comprehensions.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,660
List comprehensions are

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,270
a mechanism to write code that
manipulates collections.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,070
If we look at most programming
languages,

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,900
most of the features in a programming
language

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,510
have to do with dealing with collections.
If you look at

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:37,020
a traditional imperative language
such as Java or C#,

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,750
it has a wide range of mechanisms to
deal with collections.

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,160
For loops, while loops, do while loops

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,649
foreach loops, continue, break

13
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,480
and all these constructs are there to

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,280
iterate over collections. 

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,320
Now of course mathematicians have been
dealing with collections

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,540
for centuries.

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,659
For mathematicians the favorite

18
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:11,500
collection type is set.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,979
Sets however are computationally a
little bit awkward.

20
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:19,240
Because when you have a set it 
means that duplicated

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,509
elements are removed. Which implies that
you need equality to deal with sets.

22
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,520
Especially in a functional language like
Haskell

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,000
it's very hard, well impossible,
you have to solve the halting problem

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,439
to decide equality between functions.

25
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,460
So what

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,290
Haskell did, it took some of the ideas
that mathematicians have

27
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,000
used

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,280
for a long time to deal with sets and

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,820
simplified them to work over lists.
Lists are

30
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,810
my favorite collection type and the
reason is that a list

31
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,619
just gives you the bare minimum to
deal with a collection.

32
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,860
You can, as you have seen, if we have a
list that's composed out of a head and a

33
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,450
tail

34
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,970
you can decompose that list recursively
by just picking off the first element

35
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,569
one by one.

36
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:17,030
And that's very convenient and
that puts

37
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,139
very few restrictions on the collection
type.

38
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:25,129
Unless sets where you assume
equality of the elements or arrays where

39
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,079
you assume

40
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:30,209
constant time indexing. Sets

41
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:34,010
are in some sense the most pure form

42
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,840
of collection types. In Java eight,

43
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,900
they call these lists streams.

44
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,919
To emphasize that these are

45
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,930
collections where you can only
access the elements

46
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,079
one by one. In that sense

47
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:56,489
Haskell lists are an example of Java
eight streams in that philosophy.

48
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:59,790
Alright let's

49
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,409
look at how mathematicians use

50
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:07,159
so-called set comprehensions to define
sets.

51
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:10,949
Here's an example of a set.

52
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:14,799
It's a set of all squares

53
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:18,150
with values

54
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,599
between one and five. It's x
squared

55
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,299
where x is taken from the set
from one to five.

56
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:30,689
The result of this is the set 
{1,4,9,16,25}.

57
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:34,159
But as I said, if we take

58
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,409
x to range over functions then this
becomes really hard to implement.

59
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:43,060
So what people did

60
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,949
in functional languages is take the same
notation the same ideas

61
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:52,259
but instead of sets, use lists.
Set comprehensions from mathematics

62
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:55,280
become list comprehensions in Haskell.

63
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,290
Here's the same example written as a
list comprehension. Here you see

64
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,449
it's the list of square numbers

65
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:08,009
x squared where x is taken from
the list

66
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:11,150
one to five. You read this as x

67
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,109
is taken from the list one to five.

68
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:18,500
If you evaluate this you will see that

69
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,460
this returns the list [1,4,9,16,25].

70
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,600
But as a list not a set.

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,520
The expression

72
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,300
x taken from one to five, that's called a
generator

73
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,120
and the reason it's called a
generator is because it

74
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,919
defines how to generate values 

75
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,690
for x. So x is taken from that set.

76
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,330
Of course since everything

77
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,580
in Haskell, and that's a good

78
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,280
aspect of programming languages, has to be
compositional so you should be able to

79
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,160
just recursively use the same
structures over and over again.

80
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,380
Comprehensions can have multiple
generators.

81
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,600
Here you see an example of that:

82
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,090
we take all pairs (x, y)

83
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,500
Where x is drawn from one, two, three, 
and y

84
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,990
is drawn from four, five. What you see

85
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,169
is that the y varies

86
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:24,229
faster then the x. The result list is

87
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:27,470
(1,4) (1,5)

88
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,110
(2,4) (2,5) (3,4) (3,5).

89
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,460
Another way to look at these nested

90
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,139
generators or multiple generators is
like

91
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:41,450
a nested loop where y is inner loop

92
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:48,450
and the x is the outer loop. 
If we swap the order of the

93
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,349
generator

94
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,690
then now x

95
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,060
varies most quickly because this becomes
the inner loop. What we get now

96
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,130
is, but notice that we still

97
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,860
have here (x,y). We only swap
the order

98
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,190
of the generators not the order of the
variables.

99
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,650
Now instead of

100
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,030
this guy moving fastest, you get

101
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,889
x moving fastest. The result is (1,4)

102
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:22,440
(2,4) (3,4) et cetera

103
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,789
This notion of generators

104
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:28,820
you will recognize that

105
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,550
in many many programming languages.
In Haskell these are list comprehensions

106
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,590
if you use python

107
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,080
it also has list comprehensions.

108
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,750
Scala has for comprehensions. F#
has comprehensions.

109
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,390
C# and Visual Basic

110
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,550
have LINQ comprehensions.

111
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,500
If you look at the language like
SQL

112
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,500
which is completely built on top of
comprehensions.

113
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,950
Only there you don't write them this concisely.
You write select from where

114
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:06,270
et cetera. But it's basically the same
idea so by studying

115
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,550
list comprehensions in Haskell you
will be well equipped

116
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,020
to use the same ideas in whatever
language you encounter them in.

117
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,550
Alright,

118
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,610
now

119
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,900
we have seen a few simple examples
with generators

120
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,500
where the generators only had constants.

121
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,010
But generators can also depend on each
other.

122
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,550
Just like when you have a loop, 
the inner loop

123
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,490
can use variables from the outer loop.
With comprehensions

124
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,360
that's no different. If we look here

125
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,680
we say x is drawn from one to three.
And then

126
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,860
y is drawn from x to three.

127
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,780
So x is in scope in the generators that

128
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,710
come after it. If we execute this
comprehension

129
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,000
we get the list (1,1)

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,210
because y is drawn from one to three.

131
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:12,300
Because x starts out at one, so we
get (1,1) (1,2) (1,3).

132
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,320
Then y is exhausted.

133
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,419
We're going to check the next value
of x, that will be two.

134
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:24,570
Now y is taken from two to three so
we say

135
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,310
two to three and then the last iteration

136
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,610
we take x to be three and then y is
drawn from the list

137
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,860
three to three, so that is the last value is just

138
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,360
(3,3). But again you’re

139
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,720
totally familiar with this because this
is the same as how nested loops work

140
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,310
in any language. The inner loop
can

141
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,950
use variables defined in outer loops.

142
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,600
One of the nice things

143
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,870
of comprehensions and especially of
dependent generators

144
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,959
is that you can write very concise code.

145
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,040
For example, if we want to take a list
of lists

146
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,970
and flatten them into a single list 

147
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,450
we can do that with the following
comprehension.

148
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:19,190
We say: just give me every list
out of that list of lists.

149
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,649
Then just give me every element of
that list

150
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:27,560
and return that. This is a doubly
nested loop that goes over

151
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,190
every list in this list of lists
and just

152
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,529
yields all the values to return

153
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:38,620
a single list of type a, of the same
element type

154
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,019
as the original list. When we

155
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:46,430
concatenate [1,2,3] [4,5] and [6]

156
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,589
the result will be [1,2,3,4,5,6].

157
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,910
Very very 

158
00:09:53,910 --> 00:10:00,250
concise code that we can write
using comprehensions. Now the next thing

159
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,540
besides generators that you want to use
in a comprehension, and that's also

160
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,180
used a lot in set comprehensions is to
allow filters.

161
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,350
You want to

162
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,019
have x drawn from some collection

163
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,089
but you want to throw out certain values

164
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:22,610
for which a predicate does not hold. 
For example, if we want to have

165
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:26,050
all the even numbers between one and ten

166
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:30,339
we can just say x is drawn from
one to ten

167
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:34,399
and filter out only the even numbers. 
The result

168
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,440
of this is a list [2,4,6,8,10].

169
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,870
The even numbers between one and ten.

170
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,170
In SQL you will recognize
this as a SELECT WHERE.

171
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,220
The WHERE clause here is called a
guard

172
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,600
in Haskell and if you use a LINQ

173
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,300
list comprehension or
comprehension syntax that will be also

174
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,149
be called

175
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:02,380
WHERE.

176
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,690
Here's an

177
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,920
example that uses guards to take

178
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,750
a number and break it down into its
factors.

179
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,230
What are the factors? Well we take a
number n,

180
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,980
we take all the numbers between 1 and
n.

181
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,880
And then we only

182
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,360
retain those for which n modulo x is zero.

183
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,360
The factors of 15; we start out
with all the numbers between

184
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,430
1 and 15 and then we throw out all the
numbers

185
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,240
for which n modulo x is not zero.

186
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,420
In this case the factors are [1,3,5,15].

187
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,440
Then we can use this

188
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,339
factors function

189
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:52,740
to define a very simple

190
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,390
predicate to check whether a number 
is prime.

191
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:02,230
A number is prime if the factors of that
number are exactly the list [1,n].

192
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,589
For example, fifteen is not a prime

193
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:09,510
because the factors are not just one and
fifteen.

194
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,560
It's one three five and fifteen. But seven

195
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,420
is a prime because you can check by
using GHCi, or your

196
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,550
own favorite programming language, that
the factors of seven are one and seven.

197
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,650
So we decide that

198
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,170
seven is a prime.

199
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,830
If we want to check

200
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,810
what are the primes up to a
certain number.

201
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,490
Well we can write this simple list
comprehension where we say:

202
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,589
give me all the numbers between two and
n where n is the parameter to

203
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:44,070
this

204
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:49,089
function. Then I only want to
maintain the prime numbers. I filter out

205
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:51,579
all the numbers that are not prime.
If I want to have

206
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:55,520
all the prime numbers up to 40

207
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,600
I just run this list comprehension

208
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,290
and I get all the prime numbers. 
Of course this is not the most efficient

209
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,200
way

210
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,190
to compute prime numbers but I think
it's a very nice illustration

211
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,459
of using list comprehensions. See you

212
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,309
in the next chapter.
